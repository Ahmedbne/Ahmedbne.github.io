It was a systems failure, a modern credit machine built to look safe in good weather, then revealed to be structurally fragile the moment the climate changed. A long housing boom supplied the fuel; a sprawling securitization pipeline turned local mortgages into global “safe assets”; leverage and short-term funding provided the acceleration; and a set of widely used risk models, especially those underestimating correlated defaults and liquidity risk, helped financial institutions convince themselves that speed was stability. When U.S. house prices stopped rising and mortgage defaults climbed, losses appeared first in the riskiest corners of structured finance, then migrated, through balance sheets, collateral calls, funding markets, and panic, into the core of the global banking system. The result was a sudden stop in credit, a collapse in trade, deep recessions, and a decade-long afterlife of political and institutional change.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
