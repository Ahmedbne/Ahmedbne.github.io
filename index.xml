It was a systems failure, a modern credit machine built to look safe in good weather, then revealed to be structurally fragile the moment the climate changed. A long housing boom supplied the fuel; a sprawling securitization pipeline turned local mortgages into global “safe assets”; leverage and short-term funding provided the acceleration; and a set of widely used risk models, especially those underestimating correlated defaults and liquidity risk, helped financial institutions convince themselves that speed was stability. When U.S. house prices stopped rising and mortgage defaults climbed, losses appeared first in the riskiest corners of structured finance, then migrated, through balance sheets, collateral calls, funding markets, and panic, into the core of the global banking system. The result was a sudden stop in credit, a collapse in trade, deep recessions, and a decade-long afterlife of political and institutional change.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Are we free ?</title><link>https://ahmedbne.github.io/philosophy/freewill/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:48:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ahmedbne.github.io/philosophy/freewill/</guid><description>&lt;p>At the outset, I have chosen to write this in order to treat of a subject of no small interest, and if I could point out the obvious in this kind of chronicle, it may be of course that I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose of my own free will to begin writing this, it may be in fact that I had no choice in the matter at all. To help me decide whether I did or didn&amp;rsquo;t choose to write this, I must clarify further.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Cardinality of the Continuum Equals the Cardinality of the Power Set of the Natural Numbers</title><link>https://ahmedbne.github.io/math/continuum/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:48:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ahmedbne.github.io/math/continuum/</guid><description>&lt;p>We prove that the cardinality of the real numbers equals $2^{\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition 1 (Cardinality).&lt;/strong> Two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same &lt;em>cardinality&lt;/em>, written $|A| = |B|$, if there exists a bijection $f: A \to B$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition 2 (Cardinal Inequality).&lt;/strong> We write $|A| \leq |B|$ if there exists an injection from $A$ to $B$.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
